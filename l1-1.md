## Lvl 1 - 1 Notes

  C++ is a flexible coompiler language that can accept user input and output to the console. Lvl 1 - 1 is a tutorial on the output methods of cpp. The input and output commands introduced in 1-1 are control flow commands. They are from the `iostream` library. 
  
 ### Input
 
  There are two ways to receive user input:
- `cin` (from the `iostream` library)
- `scanf(std::string input, auto &v)` (from the `cstdio` library)
    
    `cin` is the method introduced in 1-1. It takes (a) variable(s) using the `>>` operation. It waits for an input from the console then makes the variable given to it equal to the input. It can be used in a `while` loop when the amount of inputted items are unknown. ex:
  ```cpp
  {...}
  // ^ loading some libraries
  int main(){
    // create a vector to store inputted values
    std::vector<int> arr = {};
    // teporary var to save given values
    int temp;
    // input to temp and append temp to arr while there are still more items
    while (cin >> temp) arr.push_back(temp);
    // print/output arr to console
    for (auto i : arr) printf("%d", i);
  }
  ```
### Output
  
There are also two main ways to output to the console:
 - `cout` (from the `iostream` library)
 - `printf(std::string s)` (from the `cstdio` library)

`cout` is used in the hetao tutorial. It takes a string using the flow command `<<`. It outputs the given string(s) to the console. `endl` keyword can be used to replace ``<<     "\n"`` (with a semicolon if it is the end of the line of code). Although `endl` is slower than `"\n"`, it is simpler to type.
