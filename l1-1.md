## Lvl 1 - 1 Notes

  C++ is a flexible coompiler language that can accept user input and output to the console. Lvl 1 - 1 is a tutorial on the output methods of cpp. The input and output commands introduced in 1-1 are control flow commands. They are from the `iostream` library. 
  

### Output
  
There are also two main ways to output to the console:
 - `cout` (from the `iostream` library)
 - `printf(std::string s)` (from the `cstdio` library)

`cout` is used in the hetao tutorial. It takes a string using the flow command `<<`. It outputs the given string(s) to the console. `endl` keyword can be used to replace ``<<     "\n"`` (with a semicolon if it is the end of the line of code). Although `endl` is slower than `"\n"`, it is simpler to type.
