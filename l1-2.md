### Input
 
  There are two ways to receive user input:
- `cin` (from the `iostream` library)
- `scanf(std::string input, auto &v)` (from the `cstdio` library)
    
    `cin` is the method introduced in 1-1. It takes (a) variable(s) using the `>>` operation. It waits for an input from the console then makes the variable given to it equal to the input. It can be used in a `while` loop when the amount of inputted items are unknown. ex:
  ```cpp
  {...}
  // ^ loading some libraries
  int main(){
    // create a vector to store inputted values
    std::vector<int> arr = {};
    // teporary var to save given values
    int temp;
    // input to temp and append temp to arr while there are still more items
    while (cin >> temp) arr.push_back(temp);
    // print/output arr to console
    for (auto i : arr) printf("%d", i);
  }
  ```
